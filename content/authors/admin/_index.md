Greeting! I'm Victor, a postdoctoral researcher in the [Dynamic Macroecology Group](https://www.wsl.ch/de/ueber-die-wsl/organisation/forschungseinheiten/landschaftsdynamik/dynamische-makrooekologie/) at the [Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape (WSL)](https://www.wsl.ch/en/index.html), Switzerland.
<br>

My work is centered on **developing innovative models and methods** to better **understand and forecast the dynamics of ecosystems**. With the objective of harnessing the strengths of both approaches, my focus lies in **leveraging process-based ecosystem models with machine learning to provide a more refined quantitative understanding of ecosystems and enhance our ability to forecast their responses to disruptions**. 
<br>

Besides work, I am passionate about outdoor adventures and spend my freetime climbing and going down mountains &#x1F3D4; , be it with chalk, ice-axes, skis, or a mountainbike. I also enjoy sailing and surfing from times to times. You can check out **my alpine CV** [here]({{<ref "/pages/alpine_cv.md" >}}).

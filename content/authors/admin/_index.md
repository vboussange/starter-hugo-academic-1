Greeting! I'm Victor, a postdoctoral researcher in the [Dynamic Macroecology Group](https://www.wsl.ch/de/ueber-die-wsl/organisation/forschungseinheiten/landschaftsdynamik/dynamische-makrooekologie/) at the [Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape (WSL)](https://www.wsl.ch/en/index.html), Switzerland.
<br>

My work is centered on **developing innovative models and methods** to better **understand and forecast the dynamics of ecosystems and their response to disruptions**. My focus lies at the interface between **process-based modelling and machine learning**. I am specifically interested in leveraging the extrapolation ability of mechanistic models with the flexibility of state-of-the-art data driven techniques. 
<br>

Outside of work, I am a part-time alpinist, passionate about mountain adventures and writing. I also enjoy sailing and surfing occasionally. You can check out **my alpine CV** [here]({{<ref "/pages/alpine_cv.md" >}}).

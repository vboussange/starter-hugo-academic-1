# [SciML](https://github.com/SciML/)
I am a member of the **SciML** organisation, an open source ecosystem for Scientific Machine Learning in the Julia programming language. On top of being the author of **HighDimPDE.jl**, I actively participate in the development of other packages such as [DiffEqFlux.jl](https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqFlux.jl), a library to train differential equations with data.

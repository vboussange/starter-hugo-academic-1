abstract: The processes of ecological interactions, dispersal and mutations shape the dynamics of biological communities, and analogous eco-evolutionary processes acting upon economic entities have been proposed to explain economic change. This hypothesis is compelling because it explains economic change through endogenous mechanisms, but it has not been quantitatively tested at the global economy level. Here, we use an inverse modelling technique and 59 years of economic data covering 77 countries to test whether the collective dynamics of national economic activities can be characterised by eco-evolutionary processes. We estimate the statistical support of dynamic community models in which the dynamics of economic activities are coupled with positive and negative interactions between the activities, the spatial dispersal of the activities, and their transformations into other economic activities. We find strong support for the models capturing positive interactions between economic activities and spatial dispersal of the activities across countries. These results suggest that processes akin to those occurring in ecosystems play a significant role in the dynamics of economic systems. The strength-of-evidence obtained for each model varies across countries and may be caused by differences in the distance between countries, specific institutional contexts, and historical contingencies. Overall, our study provides a new quantitative, biologically inspired framework to study the forces shaping economic change.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Analogies between organisational routines and genes, firms and phenotypes, economic activities and biological populations, and between the processes acting upon these entities, have been used to advance our qualitative understanding of mechanisms driving economic change. Yet, it remained unclear whether biological concepts can be used to quantitatively describe long-term economic change. Here, we use an inverse modelling framework together with economic time-series data to test whether eco-evolutionary processes can explain the collective dynamics of national economic activities. Comparing the support of different biologically inspired dynamic community models against a null model, we find evidence for positive interactions between economic activities and their spatial dispersal.
